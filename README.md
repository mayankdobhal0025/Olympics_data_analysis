# Olympics Analysis Project
This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit that provides insightful analysis of Olympic Games data. The application allows users to explore various aspects of the Olympics, including medal counts, athlete performances, and country-specific trends.

## Project Structure
- app.py: The main application script that runs the Streamlit app. This file contains the logic for user interaction and data visualization.
- data/: Directory containing the dataset(s) used for the analysis. This could include historical data on Olympic events, athletes, countries, and more.
- helper.py: Contains utility functions that assist with data processing, calculations, and other supportive tasks.
- preprocessor.py: Script responsible for data preprocessing. It cleans, filters, and prepares the data for analysis.
- requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the Streamlit app. This includes libraries like pandas, numpy, streamlit, etc.
- setup.sh: A shell script used to set up the environment, typically for deployment. This may include steps like installing dependencies or setting environment variables.
- Procfile: A configuration file for deploying the app on platforms like Heroku. It specifies the commands that should be run to start the app.
## Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/olympics_data_analysis.git`
`cd olympics_data_analysis`
2. Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the application:

Start the Streamlit app by executing:
`streamlit run app.py`
The app should now be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Usage
Once the app is running, you can interact with the following features:

- Medal Tally: Explore the medal count by country, year, and type of medal.
- Athlete Analysis: Analyze athlete performance based on different parameters like age, gender, and the number of medals won.
- Country-wise Analysis: View trends in Olympic performance for specific countries across different years.
- Overall Analysis: See the Overall Olympic historical analysis.
## Deployment
This project is configured for deployment on platforms like Heroku. Ensure that your Heroku CLI is set up, then deploy the app using:

`git push heroku main`
Make sure to check the setup.sh and Procfile for any necessary adjustments based on your deployment environment.
